    <p> Student interest on using mobile devices to board GRT buses </p>
        <p> The purpose of this questionaire is to gather general student interest in incorporating a mobile component to their GRT experiences. FED's is considering implementing a mobile application that will allow students with smartphones to board the GRT using their smartphones instead of their watcards. <i>This mobile app is meant as an ALTERNATIVE to using watcards, not a replacement.</i> </p>
